    <p class="message">
      I don’t even know how to put this into words, but thank you —  
      for being here, for staying, and for making me believe in light again.  
      You entered my life when I was completely lost, when I’d forgotten  
      what peace or love even felt like.  
      <br><br>   
      Somehow, without even realizing it, you healed parts of me that I thought  
      would stay broken forever. You listened, you understood, and you stayed.  
      That means everything.  
      <br><br>
      I hope apko apne gifts ache lage ho panda 🐼  
      Every word here is written with love — because you deserve to feel  
      how deeply appreciated you are.
