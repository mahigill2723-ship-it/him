      You are the calm in my chaos, the peace in my loudest days,  
      and the reason behind every soft smile I wear.  
      I don’t just love you for who you are —  
      I love you for how you make me feel,  
      for the way you turn ordinary moments into forever memories.  
      <br><br>
      Every heartbeat carries your name, and even in silence... I think of you.
