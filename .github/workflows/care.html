    <p class="message">
      Please take care of yourself — not just your body, but your heart too.  
      I know life gets heavy sometimes, and you carry it all so quietly.  
      Just a reminder: it’s okay to rest, to pause, and to breathe.  
      You matter more than you realize, and your peace means the world.  
      <br><br>
      So promise me you’ll sleep on time, eat properly, and smile — even on the tough days.
