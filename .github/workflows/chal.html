  She isn't the easiest girl to love. She has this bad habit of overthinking. She tends to overreact, and she gets a little insecure every once in a while. She will be needy for your attention. She wants to literally take up all of your time, and she'll require a lot of reassurance. She isn't capable of fully trusting you. She doesn't know when to stop fighting with you, even if she's wrong. She has no problem pushing you away if she feels like you are close to hurting her.
 <br><br>
 Loving her will stress you out. Loving her will make you angry, and loving her will break your heart at times. Loving her will test you, loving her will challenge you, and loving her will change you. It may get so demanding that you'll be tempted to walk away. It may get so hard that you'll think about giving up, and it may get so complicated that you won't want to deal with her anymore.
 <br><br>
 Loving her means you get to see her at her worst and most vulnerable, and that is something that you'll have to be strong enough to handle, because she needs someone who's patient enough to understand why she is who she is today. It's not gonna be an easy relationship with her. But if she is in love with you, then she can promise that you'll be loved with such passion and intensity that you'll forget what life felt like before she came along, because she'll always be there to put your heart back together after breaking it.
 <br><br>
 Maybe she's not the best at being loved, but she is pretty amazing at loving.
