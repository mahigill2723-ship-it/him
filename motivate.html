    <h1>For My Strongest Soul 🌙</h1>
    <p class="msg">
      You’ve been through so much, and still, you shine.  
      The way you hold yourself even when the world feels heavy  
      makes me proud beyond words.  
      <br><br>
      I’ve seen the strength in your silence, the courage behind your calm,  
      and the fire that never dies even on your lowest days.  
      <br><br>
      Whenever you doubt yourself, I want you to remember —  
      you are enough, you are doing your best, and that’s all that ever mattered.  
      You deserve peace, success, and every good thing coming your way.  
      <br><br>
      I believe in you endlessly. Always have, always will. 🌠
