    <h1>Deeply Sorry 💔</h1>
    <p class="msg">
      I know I’ve made mistakes, and I’ve hurt you in ways I never meant to.  
      Every single day, I replay moments wishing I had been softer, kinder, better.  
      You mean more to me than I can ever express, and knowing I caused you pain  
      will always ache inside me.  
      <br><br>
      I care about you more than words could ever define — not just in moments of happiness,  
      but even in silence, distance, and misunderstanding.  
      Every heartbeat carries your name, every prayer holds your peace.  
      <br><br>
      I’m sorry, not just for what happened, but for not showing you sooner  
      how much you truly mean to me.  
      You’re my calm, my comfort, and my reason to grow better every day.  
      <br><br>
      I love you, deeply, truly, endlessly.  
      <span class="line">— From my heart, to you 🕊️</span>
