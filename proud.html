    <p class="message">
      Every single day, you make me prouder than the last.  
      Watching you grow, seeing your patience and strength—it heals parts of me I didn’t even know were broken.  
      You’ve faced your storms with so much grace, and I’ve never stopped admiring the way you rise.  
      You are my safe calm after chaos, my reason to believe that light always returns.  
      <br><br>
      Thank you for being you, for never giving up, and for letting me be part of your world.
